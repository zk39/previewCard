## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- YouTube API

## Implementation

The preview card is implemented using jQuery. When the user hovers over a YouTube video, a preview card is displayed with the like count and comment count. The preview card is positioned using CSS and styled using CSS styles.

## Patch Notes and Future Updates

As I continue to develop the Youtube Preview Card, I plan to make several improvements. One area that I plan to focus on is disabling the original Youtube hover effect. Currently, my extension works by overlaying a custom preview card over the original card, but sometimes the original hover effect still appears. To address this, I will work on finding a more robust solution to completely disable the original hover effect.

In addition, I want to improve the card animation and content. Right now, the card displays the video's like and comment count, but I plan to incorporate more information, such as the video's tags and thumbnail. I also want to improve the card's design to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

Another area that I plan to explore is integrating more Youtube APIs. For example, I could use the Youtube Data API to pull in more data about the video, such as its view count and upload date. I also plan to analyze popular publisher's styles and incorporate these findings into my extension.

Overall, I am committed to continuously improving the Youtube Preview Card with the best possible experience. Stay tuned for future updates and patch notes!

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of jQuery and CSS to create a preview card for YouTube videos. It provides a useful feature for users who want to quickly see the number of likes and comments for a video. Next steps will be optimize animation and content.
